## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- [Bootstrap 5](https://getbootstrap.com/) 

### What I learned

Embarking on this project helped sharpen my skill and understanding of CSS framework(Bootstrap). I learnt major concept in bootstrap which include it grid system,flex properties(d-flex),containers and lot more. 

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```
